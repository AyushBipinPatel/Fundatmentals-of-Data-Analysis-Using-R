# Fundatmentals of Data Analysis Using R

This is the permamnemt landing page of the workshop. All materials related to the workshop can be accessed through this space.

This workshop is organised by [Department of Economics, Kanchrapara College](https://www.kanchraparacollege.ac.in/), Kalyani University. 

The aim of the workshop is to expose first time R learners with the key techniques that are essential for any one who wants to analyze data. 

Participants will be exposed to:

  * Using R and RStudio for simple computation
  * Concept of Objects in programming
  * Mathematical operation using R
  * Data Wrangling
  * Data Visualization
  * Implementing basic statistical techniques 

## Link to RStudio Cloud Workspace

During the lectures there will be planned instances where participants will have a chance to run code and play around with R and RStudio. I have set up a RStudio Cloud workspace for this purpose. This way we don't run into various installation and setup problems that can arise due to different systems and save time as well.

The RStudio cloud behaves in the same way (almost) as if you were using R through RStudio installed on you machine.

## About the Instructor

Hi, I am Ayush. I am a [RStudio Certified Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/patel+ayush/). I enjoy teaching data analysis skills using R (doing this also helps me keep pace with new developments in R).

I have received formal training in Engineering and Economics. My work is focused on understanding the process of development and my interests are in rights based laws, poverty measurement, all things data and public policy.
